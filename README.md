# Level 2 Task 1 â€“ Simple Linear Regression  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project is part of my **Data Analysis Internship at Codveda Technologies**.  

I performed a **Simple Linear Regression** using the **Churn A (80%)** dataset to build the model and the **Churn B (20%)** dataset to evaluate it.  

**Objective:** Predict **Total Day Charge** (dependent variable) from **Total Day Minutes** (independent variable).  

---

## Dataset  
- **Churn A (80%)** â†’ model building  
- **Churn B (20%)** â†’ model evaluation  

Key Columns used:  
- `Total day minutes` â†’ Independent variable (X)  
- `Total day charge` â†’ Dependent variable (y)  

---

## Workflow  
This task followed a supervised learning workflow using the provided split:  
- **Churn A (80%)** â†’ regression model building  
- **Churn B (20%)** â†’ model performance evaluation  
- **Model fitting** â†’ linear regression line between minutes and charges  
- **Evaluation** â†’ metrics (RÂ², MSE)  
- **Visualization & Interpretation** â†’ scatterplot, regression line, residuals

## ðŸ”Ž Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).  
   - Dropped irrelevant index columns.  
   - Standardized categorical values for consistency.  

2. **Survival Distribution**  
   - Plotted how many passengers survived vs. not survived.  

3. **Demographic Analysis**  
   - Compared survival by gender and age groups.  

4. **Socioeconomic Analysis**  
   - Examined class (Pclass) and fare against survival rates.  

5. **Embarkation Analysis**  
   - Analyzed survival rates by port of embarkation (C, Q, S).  

6. **Visualizations**  
   - Used histograms, bar charts, and boxplots for clarity.

## Results  

### Model Parameters  
- **Intercept:** ~0.0006 (nearly zero, no hidden fixed charge)  
- **Coefficient:** ~0.17 â†’ each additional minute adds ~0.17 to the charge  

### Model Evaluation  
- **RÂ² Score:** â‰ˆ 1.0 â†’ almost perfect fit  
- **MSE:** â‰ˆ 0 â†’ negligible error  

### Visualizations  
- **Regression Plot:** Scatterplot of actual values with regression line fit  
- **Residual Plot:** Residuals scattered randomly around zero â†’ no systematic error  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
- **Linear Relationship:** Charges increase by ~0.17 per minute of usage.  
- **Model Accuracy:** RÂ² â‰ˆ 1.0 and MSE â‰ˆ 0 â†’ nearly perfect predictions.

- **Intercept Analysis:** No hidden fixed charges (intercept negligible).
